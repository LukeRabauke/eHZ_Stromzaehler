Put the following into your configuration.yaml to calculate the Battery Voltage
out of the Analog Value.
For me the Factor is 4.337 (calibrated with a Multimeter).


sensor:

  - platform: template
    sensors:
      calculated_signal:
        friendly_name: "eHZ Battery Voltage"
        unit_of_measurement: "V"  # Replace "Your_Unit" with appropriate unit
        value_template: "{{ (states('sensor.tasmota_analog_a0') | float / 1023) * 4.337 | round(3) }}" # Adjust the calculation as needed, and round to 3 decimal places
